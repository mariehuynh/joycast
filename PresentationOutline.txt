3 minutes



We want to capture all the best moments in our lives, the things that make us happy and smile.  But some of the best are so fleeting that by the time you pull your phone out, it's gone.  The moment has passed or that cute fluffy thing hopped away.  Fussing with a camera can also get in the way of properly enjoying a moment.  It's why you hire a wedding photographer to take care of that for you... but you can't have that at all times.

This is where automation comes in.  With the help of the Emotiv headset, we can know when you're having a good experience and automatically capture a photo without needing human intervention and thus delay.  

Metrics:
So what is happiness?  We're not philosophers, we're engineers, so we built a system that takes those signals, filters, and processes them based on our metrics to create a happiness index.  When the happiness index rises above the threshhold, the camera snaps a photo, which (for this demo) is uploaded to Twitter.  Bouncing is a common problem when dealing with real world triggers so we put in a delay and rearming threshhold.  This system is efficient enough that time from smile to Twitter is about two seconds, give or take your network.

Design considerations:

Let's talk about privacy for a moment.  Of course you don't always want everything in your life automatically posted publicly and shared with the world, so when not in demo mode, we've included a nonposting setting.


Getting a good, clear photo can be difficult, especially when laughing, so we went with a chest mount instead of head.  This way, it won't interfere with the headset and the greater stability on the torso means you can have a slower shutter speed and better performance in low lighting conditions.  Have a special date in a dimly lit restaurant?  We've got you covered there too.


Future work/Improvements:
We have this proof of concept working on both Windows and Mac, and the next step is mobile.  Phones have 

Challenges/ Design considerations
  * jerky cams - body mount instead of head
    * Getting a good, clear photo is difficult, especially when laughing 
    * body mounted offers greater stability, 
      * so you can have a slower shutter speed and improve performance in low lighting conditions
      * still pointed at the subject
      * doesn't interfere with the headset
  *headset usage
    signals

  * configured for min latency for demo purposes
  * privacy concerns
    * option for saving or upload to private folder for review and custom captions
      * tweets can't be edited

  why not just a gopro?
    * too much data

Improvements
  * containment in a phone app - no extra hardware needed 
    * can be kept in a shirt pocket
  * gopro integration
  * emotion-based hashtags
  * privacy concerns
    * option for saving or upload to private folder for review
  * build an aggregator site for a community of likeminded people
    * because Twitter search has delays and angry people 
    * instagram or snapchat

  * We're also looking forward to the release of the Insight, 
  since that will offer all the features we want for mobile devices like bluetooth
  as well as saline-free connections so it's wearable on the gopro

Dev process and tools that made our lives easier
 * git
 * tweepy
 * CommandCam (for Windows) and imagesnap (for Mac)






a product that automatically takes photos of everything that makes you smile. 

Fishing your phone out of your pocket and taking a photo takes too long sometimes and the moment has passed. Or it might ruin the moment. Have you ever said "Hey, look!" but by the time they look, the fluffy bunny/yeti/whatever awesome thing is gone?


We aim to fix that. EEG headsets can track facial expressions like smiles. Just hook that up to a camera. 
  They say "The best camera is the one that's with you", and that's
